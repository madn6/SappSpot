				Tucked between two bustling city streets, The Olive Fork is a hidden gem that effortlessly
				blends rustic charm with modern elegance. From the moment I stepped inside, the warm
				lighting and subtle aroma of roasted garlic and herbs set the tone for what turned out to be
				an exceptional dining experience.
				<br />
				I started with the burrata salad, which was fresh, creamy, and perfectly balanced by the
				acidity of heirloom tomatoes and a light balsamic glaze. For the main course, I chose the
				slow-braised lamb shank, served over saffron-infused couscous—every bite was tender,
				flavorful, and clearly crafted with care.
				<br />
				The portion sizes were generous, the plating was artful, and the staff was attentive without
				being intrusive. Even the dessert, a simple but elegant lavender panna cotta, left a lasting
				impression. While the prices lean toward the higher end, the quality more than justifies it.
				Whether you’re planning a romantic dinner or simply exploring the local food scene, The
				Olive Fork deserves a spot on your must-visit list.
